# aliraytracer
A ray tracer written by Ali Caglayan.

This is a work in progress and really a proof of concept to myself. I am using it as a project to learn C++. Feel free to email me any ideas or feedback on the project at "my_username"@gmail.com. 

Project uses freeGLUT. To compile: g++ viewer.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
